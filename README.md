# Delhi Metro Network Analysis

## Goal Of The Project:
Analyze the metro network for the city to understand the distribution of the connection and how the changes has been made over the years.

For this analysis, I have used Pandas, NumPy, Folium, and Plotly.

<h4>For the code, please see the Jupyter Notebook file with the extension .ipynb </h4>

<h3>The summary of the findings will be presented here, since the visualization are not shown in the GitHub </h3>

<h4> 1. The spread of the metro network </h3>

The color here represents the different lines connecting the stops.

<h4> 2. Total number of stations opened from the year 2002 to 2019 </h4>

In the year 2007 and 2012, no any new metro lines were added, it could be due to lack of proper planning, or issue in the funds or could be any political reasons.


<p> The year 2018 has the highest number of extra metro lines, so let's see the types of layouts that were added on this year. </p>

<h4> 3. Layouts added in the year 2018 </h4>

In 2018, a total of 38 Elevated lines and 26 underground lines were added in total.

<h4> 4. The analysis of the metro lines on their average distance and the number of stops. </h4>

<h4> 5. The total layouts </h4>

The majority of the lines were Elevated, could be because these areas were already occupied by the government to execute the plan and the place where the underground lines were added could already have infrastructures built, so  buying the area to go for the Elevated line could be more expensive and hassle, so after an effective study, underground lines were more effective and reasonable.
